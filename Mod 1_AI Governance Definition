AI governance is the process of understanding the impact of AI on those in our care, and making decisions about AI in our organizations that are fair, transparent, and ethical. AI has the potential to have incredible and transformative impact. It also presents risks for schools like the amplification of bias and breaches to privacy, among others. AI governance is about establishing the systems, processes, policies, and guidelines to ensure that everyone in an organization can recognize and mitigate risks transparently, respond fairly, and make decisions with both the present and future well-being of humans in mind.
