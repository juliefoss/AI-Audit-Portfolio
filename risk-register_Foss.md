# AI Risk & Impact Register – Starter Version **Name: Julie Foss** **Institution: True Nexus Consulting LLC** **Date: 7/15/25** --- 
## Entry 1 – AI System 
**System Name:** LexiTutor
**Purpose:** To support multilingual readers with reading fluency.
**Used by:** Year 5 Students
**Risk Level (EU AI Act):** - [ ] Minimal - [ ] Limited - [ X] High - [ ] Unacceptable 
**Main Risks Identified: 1. LexiTutor records voice samples of students reading aloud. Student voices are a special category use of data, 2. LexiTutor provides feedback on pronunciation, pace, and tone and flags students who might need extra support. If these data are used to make educational decisions about students, they would be considered high risk, 3. LexiTutor stores user data to personalize reading materials over time. How and for how long those data are stored represents a potential risk to the rights and freedoms of students, 4. Potential risk of algorithmic bias against multilingual students or those with accents, 5. Power imbalance in school setting
** - - **Red Flags Noted:** - Tool uses biometric data
**Actions Taken or Needed:** - - Vendor agreement, which ensures student biometric data will not be stored and will not be used to train LexiTutor models. Regular human review of data and outputs to ensure LexiTutor advises, rather than makes decisions about student support.
